# KYR Utils
This library contains a number of "utility" functions used in KYR projects. Please feel free to use!


### buildTar()
This builder function is used to walk optional project directories, collecting files into a .tar.zst archive. 

Use the `TarBuildOptions` class in your build script to control config. Some of the preset directory options have filters in place, there's also room for additional directories to be walked indiscriminately.
```text
FILTERS
The 'overrideEnv' directory walker will grab .env config files from the root of the project.
The 'distDir' directory walker will collect everything indiscriminately.
The 'dataDir' directory walker will filter any ( .yml | .yaml | .json | .xml | .ini | .csv ) files.
The 'prismaDir' directory walker will collect everything indiscriminately.
The 'webServerDir' directory walker will ignore any files ending with `*.ts` to collect all templates, static resources etc.
The 'additionalDirs' directory walker will collect everything indiscriminately from the list of dir's provided.
```

### BuildTarOptions
This object is built and then passed as an argument to the `buildTar()` function.
```cs
export type TarBuildOptions = {
  overrideEnv: boolean;
  distDir?: string;
  dataDir?: string;
  prismaDir?: string;
  webServerDir?: string;
  additionalDirs?: string[];
};
```

#### Tar(Zst)Builder - Project Structure
Loose suggested structure to use the buildTar() utility for rapid server deployment via a .tar.zst archive.
```text
STRUCTURE
projectRoot:                    ./
projectRoot/.env ->             .env config files. 
prjectRoot/dist ->              Compiled/bundled files
projectRoot/data ->             Static datafiles for apps (YAML / JSON etc.)
projectRoot/prisma ->           Static prisma files for ORM usage (schema etc.)
projectRoot/src ->              Local deploy script (imports tarBuild() and compiles to `./dist`) & project TS files
projectRoot/webServer ->        Webserver.ts files, /views directory, /static directory
```

### getRandUUID()
Return a UUID from the Crypto library

### sleep()
Wait a defined number of seconds

### minutesElapsed()
Return a boolean from a Date object (time to judge from), and a number (number of minutes to check as passed since the Date object)

### hoursElapsed()
Return a boolean from a Date object (time to judge from), and a number (number of hours to check as passed since the Date object)

### shuffleArray()
Shuffle an Array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm

### chooseRandomFromArray()
Select a random element from an Array

### dateTimeUIString()
Return a UI-friendly date-stamp ("en-gb") from a String | Number | Date

### dateTimeFSString()
Return a filesystem-friendly date-stamp ("en-gb") from a String | Number | Date

# LATEST UPDATE
V3.0.0 - I've removed the fixed dir options for dist and made this optional like the others. You can now use this for partial deployments as well as full applications. I've also updated the function and object notes so they are clearer.
