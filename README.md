# KYR Utils
This library contains a number of "utility" functions used in KYR projects. Please feel free to use!

I've listed the functions available and their general usage below.


### buildTar()
This builder function is used to walk relevant (and optional) project directories, collecting project files into a .tar.zst archive. 

This script assumes it will be executed from inside the `./dist` folder of your project. Use the `TarBuildOptions` class in your build script to control config. Some of the preset directory options have filters in place, there's also room for additional directories to be walked indiscriminately.
```text
FILTERS
The base directory walker will include package files (Note: The override env option will grab any .env file from the project base Dir when selected.)
The `./dist` directory walker has a default filter to ignore any scripts containing the string `deploy` - To stop server uploads of compiled deploy scripts.
The optional Data directory walker will filter any ( .yml | .yaml | .json | .xml | .ini | .csv ) files.
The optional Prisma directory walker will only select files with the .prisma extension.
The optional WebServer directory walker will ignore any files ending with `*.ts` - This is to walk and collect all templates, static resources and css files.
The optional Additional directory walker has no filters and will walk and collect everything from all directories in this list.
```

### BuildTarOptions
This object is built and then passed as an argument to the `buildTar()` function.
```cs
export type TarBuildOptions = {
  overrideEnv: boolean;
  dataDir?: string;
  prismaDir?: string;
  webServerDir?: string;
  additionalDirs?: string[];
};
```

#### Tar(Zst)Builder - Project Structure
Following this structure will allow you to import and use the buildTar() utility for rapid server deployment via a .tar.zst archive.
```text
STRUCTURE
projectRoot:                    ./
projectRoot/.env ->             .env config files. *OPTIONAL*
projectRoot/data ->             Static datafiles for apps (YAML / JSON etc.) *OPTIONAL*
projectRoot/prisma ->           Static prisma files for ORM usage (schema etc.) *OPTIONAL*
projectRoot/src ->              Local deploy script (imports tarBuild() and compiles to `./dist`) & project TS files
projectRoot/src/webServer ->    Webserver.ts files, /views directory, /static directory  *OPTIONAL*
```
